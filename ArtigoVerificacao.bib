abstract = {BPMN is becoming the de facto standard for process description, analysis and simulation, in IT and many other business domains. BPMN supports different levels of abstraction, from high-level process models, to detailed models capable of being executed. Several tools now support, at least partly, OMG's BPMN metamodel specification. However, while several other OMG's metamodels include a formal specification of well-formedness rules, using OCL, the BPMN metamodel specification only includes those rules in natural language, scattered across several hundred pages of that document. Not surprisingly, we found that all mainstream BPMN tools do not enforce those well-formedness rules, while checking the correctness of process models. Model preciseness enforcement is important to mitigate ambiguity. The latter hampers the achievement of a shared meaning among process stakeholders, is detrimental to process reuse and is unacceptable if we look for executable processes. To enforce model preciseness we propose to supplement the OMG BPMN metamodel with well-formedness rules expressed as OCL invariants.},

abstract = {Creating business process models that can be shared effectively across the business - and between business and IT - demands more than a digest of BPMN shapes and symbols. It requires a step-by-step methodology for going from a blank page to a complete process diagram. It also requires consistent application of a modeling style, so that the modeler's meaning is clear from the diagram itself. Author Bruce Silver explains not only the meaning and proper usage of the entire BPMN 2.0 palette, but calls out the working subset that you really need to know. He also reveals the hidden assumptions of core concepts left unexplained in the spec, the key to BPMN's deeper meaning. The book addresses BPMN at three levels, with primary focus on the first two. Level 1, or descriptive BPMN, uses a basic working set of shapes and symbols to meet the needs of business users doing process mapping. Level 2, or analytical BPMN, is aimed at business analysts and architects. It takes advantage of BPMN's expressiveness for detailing event and exception handling, key to analyzing and improving process performance and quality. Level 3, or executable BPMN, is brand new in BPMN 2.0. Here the XML underneath the diagram shapes becomes an executable design can be deployed to a process engine to automate the process. The method and style detailed in the book aligns these three levels, facilitating business-IT collaboration throughout the process lifecycle. Inside the book you'll find discussions, illustrated with over 100 examples, about: The questions BPMN asks, and does not ask The meaning of basic concepts like starting and completing, sending and receiving, waiting and listening Subprocesses and hierarchical modeling style The five basic steps in creating Level 1 models Event and exception-handling patterns Branching and merging patterns Level 2 modeling method Elements of BPMN style: element usage and diagram composition},

@article{Mendling2008,
abstract = {This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs) and introduces a novel definition of EPC semantics. EPCs became popular in the 1990s as a conceptual business process modeling language in the context of reference modeling. Reference modeling refers to the documentation of generic business operations in a model such as service processes in the telecommunications sector, for example. It is claimed that reference models can be reused and adapted as best-practice recommendations in individual companies (see 230, 168, 229, 131, 400, 401, 446, 127, 362, 126). The roots of reference modeling can be traced back to the K lner Integrationsmodell (KIM) 146, 147 that was developed in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1990s, the Institute of Information Systems (IWi) in Saarbr cken worked on a project with SAP to define a suitable business process modeling language to document the processes of the SAP R/3 enterprise resource planning system. There were two results from this joint effort: the definition of EPCs 210 and the documentation of the SAP system in the SAP Reference Model (see 92, 211). The extensive database of this reference model contains almost 10,000 sub-models: 604 of them non-trivial EPC business process models. The SAP Reference model had a huge impact with several researchers referring to it in their publications (see 473, 235, 127, 362, 281, 427, 415) as well as motivating the creation of EPC reference models in further domains including computer integrated manufacturing 377, 379, logistics 229 or retail 52. The wide-spread application of EPCs in business process modeling theory and practice is supported by their coverage in seminal text books for business process management and information systems in general (see 378, 380, 49, 384, 167, 240). EPCs are frequently used in practice due to a high user acceptance 376 and extensive tool support. Some examples of tools that support EPCs are ARIS Toolset by IDS Scheer AG, AENEIS by ATOSS Software AG, ADONIS by BOC GmbH, Visio by Microsoft Corp., Nautilus by Gedilan Consulting GmbH, and Bonapart by Pikos GmbH. In order to facilitate the interchange of EPC business process models between these tools, there is a tool neutral interchange format called EPC Markup Language (EPML) 283, 285, 286, 287, 289, 290, 291. The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: Section 2.1 gives a brief, informal description of EPC syntax and semantics and introduces the notation by the help of an example. Section 2.2 discusses several approaches to EPC syntax formalization and consolidates them in one definition. Section 2.3 presents various extensions that were proposed for EPCs. Section 2.4 covers different approaches to formal semantics of EPCs and introduces the semantics definition that is used later in this book. A respective implementation of these semantics in ProM is also described. Finally in Section 2.5, EPCs are compared to other business process modeling languages. The chapter concludes with a summary in Section 2.6.},

abstract = {Business process modeling is an important corporate activity, but the understanding of what constitutes good process models is rather limited. In this paper, we turn to the cognitive dimensions framework and identify the understanding of the structural relationship between any pair of model elements as a hard mental operation. Based on the weakest-link metaphor, we introduce the cross-connectivity metric that measures the strength of the links between process model elements. The definition of this new metric builds on the hypothesis that process models are easier understood and contain less errors if they have a high cross-connectivity. We undertake a thorough empirical evaluation to test this hypothesis and present our findings. The good performance of this novel metric underlines the importance of cognitive research for advancing the field of process model measurement.},

Despite the extensive application of process modeling in practice there are hardly empirical results available on quality aspects of process models. This paper aims to advance the understanding of this matter by analyzing the connection between formal errors (such as deadlocks) and a set of metrics that capture various structural and behavioral aspects of a process model. In particular we discuss the hypothetical relationship between errors and metrics, and provide a validation of correlation based on an extensive sample of EPC process models from practice.

While the extensions have fixed some of the limitations of the initial framework, other limitations remain. In particular, the framework is too static in its view upon semantic quality, mainly considering models, not modelling activities, and comparing these models to a static domain rather than seeing the model as a facilitator for changing the domain. Also, the framework's definition of pragmatic quality is quite narrow, focusing on understanding, in line with the semiotics of Morris, while newer research in linguistics and semiotics has focused beyond mere understanding, on how the model is used and impact its interpreters. The need for a more dynamic view in the semiotic quality framework is particularly evident when considering process models, which themselves often prescribe or even enact actions in the problem domain, hence a change to the model may also change the problem domain directly. This paper discusses the quality framework in relation to active process models and suggests a revised framework based on this.},

abstract = {Business process modeling is heavily applied in practice, but important quality issues have not been addressed thoroughly by research. A notorious problem is the low level of modeling competence that many casual modelers in process documentation projects have. Existing approaches towards model quality might be of benefit, but they suffer from at least one of the following problems. On the one hand, frameworks like SEQUAL and the Guidelines of Modeling are too abstract to be applicable for novices and non-experts in practice. On the other hand, there are collections of pragmatic hints that lack a sound research foundation. In this paper, we analyze existing research on relationships between model structure on the one hand and error probability and understanding on the other hand. As a synthesis we propose a set of seven process modeling guidelines (7PMG). Each of these guidelines builds on strong empirical insights, yet they are formulated to be intuitive to practitioners. Furthermore, we analyze how the guidelines are prioritized by industry experts. In this regard, the seven guidelines have the potential to serve as an important tool of knowledge transfer from academia into modeling practice. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
